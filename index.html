		<p>Lorem ipsum is starting to get on my nerves so this is About filler until I can think of something more clever and professional to write. I have been coding for four months. My lessons started with the Intro to JS/HTML/CSS courses on Khan Academy. I got some basic knowledge about OOP from that and  decided that I hate CSS. Then I jumped into the video tutorials  by Daniel Shiffman at Coding Train. He gave me new perspectives on some fundamental concepts that I missed in the Khan lectures and his animation/physics videos and guest lectures are addicting. I watched one last night that had me recreate the “Matrix rain”. Besides that artsy stuff some of his tutorials about API’s have excited me - including one where I made a map that pinpoints all the earthquakes in the world over the past 30 days. So right now I’m really enjoying animation and maps. I get really excited when I think of how much I’ll know about those two subjects in six months, a year, ten years, and so on…</p>
